       <div class="description"> <p>The oakridge international school welcome kit was made for the sole purpose of helping you and other introverted students get used to their new learning environment. We can understand how hard it is for an introvert to adjust to their new environment that that is why we made a welcome kit especially made for introverts. You will not have to worry about making friends and getting used to the school environment after buying this welcome kit. The welcome kit comes with three items, a bottle, a pencil box, and a box of chocolates. It also includes a card with information about the school and tips on how to make friends.</p>

            <p>Through your journey at Oakridge, there will always be students and teachers that will help you get through your struggles. Don't hesitate to ask for help. In this school, there will be teachers and students who are willing to help you and there are students who are just like you. You will be able to relate with those students and make new friends. We also have our very own school counselor. If you face a problem that you think your friends or teachers won’t be able to help you with, then you can always approach the school counselor.  </p>
